# lint-react
A library for linting TypeScript and JavaScript ReactJS projects. Linting is achieved using a combination of eslint, stylelint and prettier. ESlint is a code quality inspector, stylelint is a linter
for CSS and prettier is a code formatter. This library can bootstrap a project with linting support and allows you to customize settings in a non-proprietary way. This library is designed to be used\
as a dependency in a project. It is not designed to be used as a standalone project. If you have suggestions or have any problems, please open an issue on the
[d-leb/lint-react issues board](https://github.com/d-leb/lint-react/issues).
